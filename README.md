## üß© Database Schema

Create a MySQL database called `hospital` and run the following SQL commands to create required tables:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE hospital;

USE hospital;

CREATE TABLE patients (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT,
    gender VARCHAR(10)
);

CREATE TABLE doctors (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    specialization VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE appointments (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    patient_id INT,
    doctor_id INT,
    appointment_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (patient_id) REFERENCES patients(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (doctor_id) REFERENCES doctors(id)
);

üöÄ How to Run
Make sure MySQL is installed and running.

Create the database and tables as described above.

Open the project in any Java IDE (like IntelliJ or Eclipse).

Update the database credentials inside HospitalManagementSystem.java:

private static final String url = "jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/hospital";
private static final String userName = "root";
private static final String password = "your_password";
